# Sound Syntax - Alpha

**Sound Syntax** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance your coding experience through auditory feedback. It plays customizable audio cue when your cursor hovers over the beginning of a token in your code, helping you easily identify different syntax elements. This feature is especially beneficial for **screen reader users**, as it provides audio cues for code elements.

At the bottom of the interface, an informational message labeled "keyword"; indicates the type of token currently being hovered over. This auditory feedback feature helps users easily identify syntax elements in their code.](https://i.imgur.com/YjnxG06.png)
